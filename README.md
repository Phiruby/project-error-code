# project-error-code
This is a unique Project where players go out in an open world and try to create as many bugs in enemy's code! As they defeat enemies, players obtain new codeblocks that they can use to create more creative bugs in the enemy's program!

## Gameplay

Welcome to "Error = More Code"! Here, players can set out on an adventure in an open-world to defeat enemies, create bugs, obtain new items, and become the best code bugger!

You can find enemies by moving around. And hey, if you are lucky, you may encounter the classic Cup'O Java

The below image depicts what the battle screen looks like. On the left, players have all their items. They can use any of them to create bugs!
However, **as the enemy levels get higher, they learn to debug their program! Higher level enemies will require more creative forms of bugs to defeat them**
When an enemy prints a line of code, the player takes 20 damage. If the enemy uses "bot.attack();" then the player takes 40 damage!
The player can also use unique features, such as glasses, which show the player how the enemy will debug; or bandage, which can recover some health.
The player can also use classical programming features to create bugs, such as while loops, operators, variables, and numbers!

To obtain new items, the player should defeat higherlevel bots! **To defeat a bot, either make sure there is a bug in the bot's code, OR the bot does no damage to the player**

That's it! Now you're ready to become the best code bugger in the game!
